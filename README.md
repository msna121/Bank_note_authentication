# Bank_note_authentication
## Overview
This is an end to end project of machine learning using Kaggle data set.

## Objective
Data was extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. 
The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. 
Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
The authenticity of the bank notes is to be predicted based on the extracted features and deploy the model on docker and streamlit.

## Tools used
Python3, Jupyter notebook, flask, docker, streamlit.
